## Repository Contents

### `mathematics_warning_comments_not_in_english.ipynb`
This notebook demonstrates the process of propensity score matching (PSM) using the R MatchIt package, using mathematics subject as an example. For additional information, please refer to the official MatchIt documentation: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/vignettes/MatchIt.html (highly recommended).

This notebook contains R code in Jupyter format. See https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel for setup information.
You can also run the code in RStudio or other R IDEs.

### `coefficient_vis.ipynb`
Code to generate visualizations of treatment effect sizes and their associated uncertainty.
